# LITA-CAPSTONE-PROJECT SALES DATA
This is where I documented my first project while learning Data Analysis with the Incubator Hub

## PROJECT TITLE: SALES DATA
This project deals with analyzing the sales performance of a retail store.This dataset captures transactional sales data, providing a detailed view of customer orders, including product, region, and revenue information. It involves analyzing sales trends, regional performance, enabling insights into the drivers of revenue and high-demand products. The goal is to produce an interactive Power BI dashboard that highlights these findings.

The dataset includes the following field:
- OrderID: A unique identifier for each order.
- CustomerId: A unique identifier for each customer placing an order.
- Product: The specific product purchased in each transaction.
- Region: The geographical location (e.g., North, South, East, West) where the order was placed.
- OrderDate: The date when the order was made.
- Quantity: The number of units purchased for each product in an order.
- UnitPrice: The price per unit of the product.
- Total Sales: The total sales value for the order, calculated as Quantity * UnitPrice

### Tools used
- Microsoft excel - For Data Cleaning, Analysis and Visualisation
