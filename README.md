# LITA-CAPSTONE-PROJECT SALES DATA
This is where I documented my first project while learning Data Analysis with the Incubator Hub

## PROJECT TITLE: SALES DATA
This project deals with analyzing the sales performance of a retail store.This dataset captures transactional sales data, providing a detailed view of customer orders, including product, region, and revenue information. It involves analyzing sales trends, regional performance, enabling insights into the drivers of revenue and high-demand products. The goal is to produce an interactive Power BI dashboard that highlights these findings.
